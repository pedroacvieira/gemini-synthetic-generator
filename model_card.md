## Method Summary

The Gemini Synthetic Data Generator uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model for object and text insertion into images. This approach treats synthetic data generation as a **visual reasoning task** rather than a traditional computer vision pipeline.

**Core Algorithm:**
1. **Scene Analysis**: Gemini analyzes the input image to understand context, lighting, and spatial relationships
2. **Prompt Construction**: Dynamic prompt generation based on scene content and insertion requirements
3. **Direct Generation**: Gemini generates the final image with seamlessly integrated objects or text

**Key Innovation**: By leveraging multimodal AI capabilities, the system eliminates the need for object detection pipelines, manual mask generation, or complex image composition algorithms. The model understands scene semantics and generates realistic insertions through natural language instructions.

## Limitations

### Realism Challenges
- **Consistency Variance**: AI generation may produce varying quality across similar scenes
- **Complex Scenes**: Performance degrades with highly cluttered or complex backgrounds
- **Fine Detail Control**: Limited precise control over exact placement coordinates
- **Style Consistency**: Text styling and object appearance may vary between generations
- **Hallucinations**: Occasional unrealistic artifacts or placements

### Technical Constraints
- **API Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection and Google API availability
- **API Availability**: Requests can fail when the server is busy
- **Model Limitations**: Bound by Gemini's current capabilities and training data
- **Rate Limiting**: Processing speed limited by API quotas
- **Cost Scaling**: Per-image API costs make large-scale generation expensive

### Common Artifacts
- Occasional blending artifacts around object edges
- Erasing or distortion of main scene elements
- Lighting inconsistencies in complex scenes
- Inconsistent shadowing or reflections
- Text misalignment or warping
- Resolution-dependent quality variations
- Unexpected object orientations
- Cannot handle hair when placing hats

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Integration points for manual review and correction

### Technical Improvements
- **Local Model Integration**: Hybrid approach with local preprocessing to reduce API dependency
- **Two-Stage Generation**: Initial rough placement with traditional approach followed by refinement pass with Gemini
- **Distributed Processing**: Multi-API-key support for parallel processing
- **Quality Gates**: Configurable quality thresholds for automated acceptance/rejection
