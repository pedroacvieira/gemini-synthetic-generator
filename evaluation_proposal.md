# Synthetic Data Evaluation Proposal

## Overview

This proposal outlines how to evaluate the quality and utility of synthetic data generated by the Gemini Synthetic Data Generator across four key areas: visual realism, label accuracy, sample diversity, and training usefulness.

---

## 1. Visual Realism

### Automated Metrics
- **FID Score**: Compare real vs synthetic image distributions (target: <30)
- **LPIPS**: Measure perceptual similarity (target: <0.3)
- **CLIPScore**: Semantic alignment between images and descriptions (target: >0.7)

### Human Evaluation
- Expert review panel scoring integration quality, lighting, and realism (1-5 scale)
- Crowdsourced "real or fake" classification (target: <30% detection rate)

---

## 2. Label Accuracy

### Object Detection Validation
- **IoU Analysis**: Compare predicted vs ground truth bounding boxes (target: mIoU >0.7)
- **Detection Models**: Test with YOLOv8, RCNN for precision/recall metrics
- **Classification**: Verify object class consistency (target: >95% accuracy)

### Contextual Appropriateness
- CLIP-based scoring of object-scene compatibility (target: >0.6)

---

## 3. Sample Diversity

### Statistical Analysis
- **Spatial Coverage**: Measure insertion location distributions across image regions
- **Visual Variety**: Color histograms, texture analysis, structural similarity
- **Scenario Coverage**: Different lighting, scene types, object orientations (target: >80%)

---

## 4. Training Utility

### Performance Benchmarks
- Train object detection models with synthetic + real data
- Measure mAP improvement over real-only baseline (target: >5%)
- Test sample efficiency: how many real samples does 1 synthetic replace?

### Few-Shot Learning
- Evaluate utility when real training data is limited
- Particularly important for rare object classes

---

## Implementation

### Automated Pipeline
```python
class SyntheticDataEvaluator:
    def evaluate_batch(self, images, metadata):
        return {
            'visual_quality': self.assess_realism(),
            'label_accuracy': self.validate_labels(),
            'diversity': self.measure_diversity(),
            'training_utility': self.benchmark_performance()
        }
```

### Quality Gates
**Accept if:**
- FID < 30 AND LPIPS < 0.4 AND CLIPScore > 0.6
- mIoU > 0.6 for bounding boxes
- Human evaluation > 3.5/5.0
- Training improvement > 5%

---

## Expected Results

**Success Targets:**
- Visual realism: FID < 25, human detection < 25%
- Label accuracy: mIoU > 0.7, classification > 95%
- Diversity: >80% scenario coverage
- Training utility: >10% performance improvement

This framework provides systematic evaluation ensuring both technical quality and practical utility for machine learning applications.
